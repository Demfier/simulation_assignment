# Assignments:
  1. [**Fighter-Target Problem**](assignment1.py): The initial co-ordinate of a fighter plane is given which is supposed to hit a bombing site. The bombing site is moving and its co-ordinates at 1 second interval are given. If the velocity of the bomb is 20 kmph and it is always directed towards the bombing site, determine whether the bomb will hit the bombing site successfully or not.
**Note**: The bomb would be said to successfully hit the target if it is within 10km proximity of the target at point of time.
